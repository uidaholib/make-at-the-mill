# Explore the MILL

We have several short demonstration activities to share some of the technology in the MILL:

## Button Maker

Makerspaces aren't all about digital tools--the MILL features many outlets for your creativity.
Our button maker is one of our most popular devices!

## Vinyl Cutter

Our [Silhouette Cameo](http://www.silhouetteamerica.com/shop/machines/cameo) uses a small blade to cut paper, card stock, vinyl, fabric and more following a design you create on the computer. 
The software allows you to convert images or sketches into decals!

## MakeyMakey 

[MakeyMakey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) is a simple gadget that turns anything into a touchpad!
Connect the allegator clips to the MakeyMakey board and an object, then hold the ground wire. 
Touch the object to create a connection.
The MakeyMakey acts like a keyboard or mouse for any program on your computer--get creative to come up with some wacky interfaces!

## Raspberry Pi 

[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a single board computer that is cheap, hackable, and fun! 
This simple computer runs [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), a Linux-based operating system that can do everything it's bigger laptop cousins can do. 
RPI is great for learning to code, building projects, or just playing some games!

## VR / AR

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are emerging tech with ever increasing use cases. 
The MILL has several simple devices to start exploring the possibilities!

- [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) ([apps](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/apps/), [Chrome Experiments](https://vr.chromeexperiments.com/))
- [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) sensor
