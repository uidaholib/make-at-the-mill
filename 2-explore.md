## Button Maker

Making isn't all about digital tools--the MILL features many outlets for your creativity.
Our button maker is one of our most popular devices!

## MakeyMakey

Connect the allegator clips to the MakeyMakey board and an object, then hold the ground wire. 
Touch the object to create a connection.
The MakeyMakey acts like a keyboard or mouse for any program on your computer--use your creativity to come up with some wacky interfaces!
