# Explore the MILL

We have three short demonstration activities to share some of the technology in the MILL:

## Button Maker

Makerspaces aren't all about digital tools--the MILL features many outlets for your creativity.
Our button maker is one of our most popular devices!

## MakeyMakey 

[MakeyMakey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) is a simple gadget that turns anything into a touchpad!
Connect the allegator clips to the MakeyMakey board and an object, then hold the ground wire. 
Touch the object to create a connection.
The MakeyMakey acts like a keyboard or mouse for any program on your computer--get creative to come up with some wacky interfaces!
