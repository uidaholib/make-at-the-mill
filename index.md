Join us for a hands-on session in [The MILL](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/mill), UI Library's Making, Innovating, and Learning Laboratory! 

This workshop introduces Idaho 4-H students to the amazing and fun technology in The MILL, while engaging with emerging technologies that offer the stepping stones for solving real world challenges of the future. 
The two-hour workshop offers students a chance to take part in innovative and playful hands-on activities while building digital skills essential to all types of careers, from science and technology to the arts. 
The first hour will allow time for demonstration and exploration of The MILLâ€™s many resources, including tools for fabricating and printing (3-D printer and vinyl cutter); open source electronic-based tools for coding and programming (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Makey Makey); and tools for virtual and augmented reality (Google cardboard, View-Master, and Leap Motion). 
During the second half of the workshop, students will use their creativity and curiosity to collaborate with their peers on a simple electronics-based project using Arduino that will stimulate and develop their interest in engineering and technology.
